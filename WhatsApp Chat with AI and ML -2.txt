13/10/22, 21:37 - Harshita: THERE IS A REASON FOR EVERYTHING 🌿

After the attacks of September 11, a company that had its offices at the World Trade Center invited its executives and employees who had for some reason survived the attack to share their experiences.

People were alive for the smallest reasons were small details like these:

- The director of a company was late because it was his son's first kindergarten day;

- A woman was delayed because her alarm clock didn't ring in time;

- One was late because he was stuck on the road where there was an accident;

- Another survivor missed the bus;

- Someone threw food on themselves and needed the time to change;

- One had a problem with his car, which did not start;

- Another one returned to answer the phone;

- Another one had a baby!

- Another didn't get a taxi.

- But the story that impressed the most was that of a man who put on a new pair of shoes that morning, and before he got to work he had a blister. He stopped at the pharmacy for a band aid and that's why he's alive today.

- Now when I get stuck in traffic; - when I lose an elevator;
- when I return to answering a phone;
And many other things that desperate me, I think first:

′′ This is the exact place you should be right now "...

- Next time your morning seems crazy, the kids take time to get dressed, don't find the car keys, find all the red lights...
- don't get angry or frustrated.

YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE... AT THE EXACT TIME.

07/12/22, 09:22 - Harshita: 1 *.Soft Failure* 
Soft failure is the type of failure that causes the loss in volatile memory of the computer and not in the persistent storage. Here, the information stored in the non-persistent storage like main memory, buffers, caches or registers, is lost. They are also known as system crash. The various types of soft failures are as follows −

Operating system failure.
Main memory crash.
Transaction failure or abortion.
System generated error like integer overflow or divide-by-zero error.
Failure of supporting software.
Power failure.

 *2.Hard Failure* 

A hard failure is the type of failure that causes loss of data in the persistent or non-volatile storage like disk. Disk failure may cause corruption of data in some disk blocks or failure of the total disk. The causes of a hard failure are −

Power failure.
Faults in media.
Read-write malfunction.
Corruption of information on the disk.
Read/write head crash of disk.
Recovery from disk failures can be short, if there is a new, formatted, and ready-to-use disk on reserve. Otherwise, duration includes the time it takes to get a purchase order, buy the disk, and prepare it.

 *3.Network Failure* 
Network failures are prevalent in distributed or network databases. These comprises of the errors induced in the database system due to the distributed nature of the data and transferring data over the network. The causes of network failure are as follows −

Communication link failure.
Network congestion.
Information corruption during transfer.
Site failures.
Network partitioning.

19/01/23, 09:15 - Harshita: 1 bSemantic understanding is important for natural language processing (NLP) because it allows computers to understand the meaning of human language. Without a deep understanding of semantics, NLP systems would be limited to simple tasks such as word matching and pattern recognition, and would not be able to understand the complexities of human language.
19/01/23, 09:15 - Harshita: 1f
Predicate argument structure, also known as valency, is a linguistic concept that describes the way in which the arguments (also known as complements) of a verb or predicate are related to the verb. It refers to the number and type of arguments that a verb or predicate can take, as well as the grammatical roles that these arguments play in a sentence
19/01/23, 09:15 - Harshita: 1g
Discourse processing in natural language processing (NLP) refers to the study of how meaning is constructed and conveyed in text or speech beyond the sentence level. It involves analyzing the way that sentences and paragraphs are connected to each other, and how they contribute to the overall meaning of a text. This includes understanding the relationships between clauses and sentences, as well as the pragmatic and pragmatic functions of language.
19/01/23, 09:15 - Harshita: 1h
Cohesion in NLP refers to the way in which words, phrases, and sentences within a text relate to each other to create a cohesive and coherent whole. This can include the use of pronouns, conjunctions, and other linking words, as well as the repetition of key terms and concepts. Cohesion is important for making text easy to understand and follow, and can help to create a sense of flow and continuity in a text.
